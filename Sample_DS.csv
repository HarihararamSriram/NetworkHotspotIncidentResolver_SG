Type and Incident,Resolution
Unauthorized Access Points - Rogue Access Points Description: Unauthorized access points set up by attackers can compromise the network's security.,"Regularly scan for rogue access points using tools like wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS), and employ strong access controls with WPA3 encryption."
Unauthorized Access Points - Misconfigured Access Points Description: Access points with incorrect configurations can lead to security vulnerabilities.,"Implement a configuration management process, conduct regular security audits, and follow best practices for access point settings."
Unauthorized Access Points - Insider Threats Description: Malicious actions by authorized personnel can pose serious threats to network security.,"Implement strict role-based access controls (RBAC), monitor user activities using security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and provide cybersecurity training to employees."
Unauthorized Access Points - Weak Authentication Mechanisms Description: Inadequate authentication methods can lead to unauthorized access.,"Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong password policies, and enforce regular password updates."
Unauthorized Access Points - Credential Leakage Description: Storing credentials insecurely can result in their leakage and compromise.,"Use secure password management tools, encrypt stored credentials, and avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts or configuration files."
Data Interception and Eavesdropping - Man-in-the-Middle Attacks Description: Attackers intercept and modify communications between two parties.,"Implement end-to-end encryption (E2EE) using protocols like HTTPS, SSH, and VPNs."
Data Interception and Eavesdropping - Unencrypted Communication Description: Transmitting data in plain text exposes it to eavesdropping.,Enforce encryption for sensitive data in transit using protocols like TLS/SSL.
Data Interception and Eavesdropping - Weak Encryption Protocols Description: Outdated or weak encryption protocols can be exploited by attackers.,Use the latest encryption algorithms and disable deprecated protocols like SSLv3.
Data Interception and Eavesdropping - Insecure Wi-Fi Connections Description: Connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks can expose sensitive data.,"Avoid using open Wi-Fi networks, employ VPNs for secure connections, and configure devices not to automatically connect to unknown networks."
Data Interception and Eavesdropping - Sniffing Attacks Description: Attackers capture network traffic to gain sensitive information.,"Use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect and block sniffing attempts, and segment network traffic to limit its scope."
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - Distributed DoS Attacks Description: Multiple compromised systems overwhelm network resources.,"Implement traffic filtering and rate limiting, and use DoS protection services or appliances."
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - Resource Exhaustion Description: Attackers consume network resources to disrupt services.,"Regularly monitor resource utilization, implement load balancing, and use firewalls to filter traffic."
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - Amplification Attacks Description: Attackers use amplification techniques to increase the impact of their attacks.,"Disable unused services, filter traffic at network borders, and update and patch vulnerable services."
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - Zero-Day Exploits Description: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities before they are patched.,"Keep systems and software up to date, apply patches promptly, and implement intrusion prevention systems."
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - Botnet Attacks Description: Large networks of compromised devices are used to launch attacks.,"Regularly update and patch devices, use intrusion detection systems, and employ IP reputation filtering."
